            Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan 
            over a medium heat. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt 
            and fry for 8-10 mins, or until the onion has turned golden brown

        Chop the chicken into chunky 3cm pieces, add to the pan and fry for
        5 mins before stirring through the spice paste and tomatoes, along with
        250ml water. Bring to the boil, lower to a simmer and cook on a gentle
        heat uncovered for 25-30 mins or until rich and slightly reduced. Stir
        though the yogurt, coriander and ground almonds, season and serve with 
        warm naan or fluffy basmati rice.
